# Interface to oerebkrmtrsfr 2.0

The interface was created by the following steps.

## Creating a XML Schema based on ILI model

The tool version used was: [ili2c-5.2.8](https://downloads.interlis.ch/ili2c/ili2c-5.2.8.zip)

Please look for newer versions if you update the workflow.

The ili model used [OeREBKRMtrsfr_V2_0.ili](OeREBKRMtrsfr_V2_0.ili)

```shell
java -jar ili2c-5.2.8/ili2c.jar -oXSD OeREBKRMtrsfr_V2_0.ili > OeREBKRMtrsfr_V2_0.xsd
```

## Creating python interface

The XML schema produced by the above step was used as input to
[generateDS 2.41.4](https://pypi.org/project/generateDS/2.41.4/)
to produce the python interface.

Generated by generateDS

```shell
generateDS -o classes.py --create-mandatory-children --member-specs=dict OeREBKRMtrsfr_V2_0.xsd
```
